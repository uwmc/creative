# Minecraft
Welcome to the UWaterloo Minecraft Server

We have two modes running, **creative mode**, where we are trying to build the campus, and **survial mode**, where we try to survive?

To connect to the server use `uwmc.club` as the server address. 

This will connect you to the creative mode. Once connected you can issue the follow command to switch between modes:
```
/server           # This will list all the availiable servers running
/server creative  # This will switch you to the creative server
/server survival  # This will switch you to the survival server
```

## Creative Mode

Direct server address: `creative.uwmc.club`

## Survival Mode

Direct server address: `survival.uwmc.club`
